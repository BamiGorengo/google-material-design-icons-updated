# Material design icons, updated set

Material design icons is the official [icon set](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google.  The icons are designed under the [material design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/).

### Updated set

This is updated version of icons, directly from [material.io](https://material.io/tools/icons/).

You can find older version of this icons set in [google/material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) repository.

Because official repository is no longer maintained, I have decided to make alternative repository with latest icons.

## Getting Started

Version 3 that is available in official icons repository only includes 1 variation of each icon.

This repository includes several variations for each icon:

* baseline
* sharp
* outline
* round
* twotone

Unlike old repository, this repository for now includes only SVG files. If you need PNG files, please open issue on this repository and specify what size/color you need PNG files.

This readme explains how to use updated icons set in your projects.
